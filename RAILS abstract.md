# Notes about the research project 

From the makerspace / DS perspective ...

The collection is a teaching tool that can be used for 
learning about digital scholarship. 
Follows on from the digital scholarship material 
used in the WAGUl workshp that I did recently and
have written about, and can be substantiated with the literature. 

Interested in:

1) creating digital data from the collection
- scanned digital files including 3D with metadata and 

2) making it accessible, displaying it, using it in 
publications like Scalar or LODBooks,
or other 3D environments perhaps, AR/VR

3) playing around with the lists, csv files of titles, list of materials; 
and then using this data to do visualisations and other kinds of representations. 
Also play with related datasets such as her bibliography compiled in Zotero.

4) interacting / collaborating? with scholars who are using the material

So it is starting from the ground up, and then exploring/ 
learning through making things with the 
created data - mainly digital making, but also physical making.  
We can also evaluate the tools as we experiment with them.  
It is about exploring ways of providing a description of the library, 
its history, telling the story of the collection, and along with that, Cherry's story.  

We will be using a different teaching method, one that is learning through doing, working on
the project. Students and others can come in at any point and do a project relating
to it, big or small.
