# Notes about the research project 

## Introduction to the collection 

- what is involved in 


## Collaboration / Community building - archive as community 
- AFSAAP and the academic community (African Scholarship)
- Curtin FAculty MCCA / Info Studies (LARIS) 
- Curtin Library - JCPML and Makerspace (Digital Scholarship) 

## Digital Scholarship 
- outline my understanding of what it is and how the Gertzel collection fits in 

The collection is a teaching tool that can be used for 
learning about digital scholarship. 
Follows on from the digital scholarship material 
used in the WAGUl workshp that I did recently and
have written about, and can be substantiated with the literature. 

Interested in:

1) creating digital data from the collection
- scanned digital files including 3D with metadata and 

2) making it accessible, displaying it, using it in 
publications like Scalar or LODBooks,
or other 3D environments perhaps, AR/VR

3) playing around with the lists, csv files of titles, list of materials; 
and then using this data to do visualisations and other kinds of representations. 
Also play with related datasets such as her bibliography compiled in Zotero.

So it is starting from the ground up, and then exploring/ learning through making things with the created data - mainly digital making, but also physical making. We can also evaluate the tools as we experiment with them. It is about exploring ways of providing a description of the library, its history, telling the story of the collection, and along with that, Cherry's story as a way of exploring digital storytelling - and similarly experimenting with techniques, tools, etc. 

We will be using a different teaching method, one that is learning through doing, working on
the project. Students and others can come in at any point and do a project relating
to it, big or small.

Library Hacky Hour; LOD working group are two ways to develop projects; but there are others as well; LARIS students; staff strainign sessions, alot of potential re developing a DH program. 

There are lots of interesting issues, but one in particular is the question of the library as a partner in research.  There
is debate and discussion around this question. 

## Communication and publishing

- interest in history and research; write Cherry's story using LOD; explore ways of writing history, writing biography, and linking data within a project and outside as well.  So explore linked open data, and also data visualisations and way of writing non-linear tezt.
